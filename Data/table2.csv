The interview was conducted before World Cup. That was why they all went for Maradona. They chose maradona based on sentiment that Messi had never won them world cup back then. I have seen this clip before even long before world cup. So don't come and make Yourselves happy here. The only GOAT ever liveth touched by god of football is Messi and no other person comes close.

"State terrorism is the long-unrecogniz\ned fraternal twin of vigilante terrorism.\n\nThe Zionist inhumane brutality we witness, along with the flagrant complicity of the Biden administration et al., reveal two aspects of the godlessness of our world.\n\nFirstly, echoing Nietzsche's anticipation, we’re engulfed in an era of extreme moral relativism and a desanctificatio\nn of life. This reality plunges many into deep moral quandaries, leaving them unable to condemn blatantly evident collective punishment.\n\nTheir struggle stems as much from ignorance and misinformation as from a disconnection from traditional moral values, blurring their sense of right and wrong.\n\nSecondly, there’s the ironic ‘religious’ godlessness and distorted morality inherent in Zionism and Christian Zionism.\n\nTheir convergence has seen one party practicing the systematic slaughter of innocent civilians and children as ‘Philistines’ under a deluded notion of divine sanction — the Biblical concept of ‘Herem’, a Hebrew term for sacred extermination — while the other party is eagerly supportive in anticipation of Armageddon and the second coming of Christ.\n\nWelcome to our world, where the normalization of state terrorism and collective punishment stands as a grim testament to the erosion of humanity’s moral compass.\nMoez masoud\nكلام الحبيب زين العابدين علي الجفري حفظه الله مترجمة للإنجليزية",2023-11-23,Thursday,23:55:00

"** ARE YOU READY !? **\n\nMost importantly we should Recognise that we did not just exist we are here for a purpose and we have were we come from and were we are going. We were all created by God for His Glory that is to bear his image and we should remember that it is appointed for a man once to die and then Judgement. We should be ready because anytime your life can be demanded from you. Make sure you are ready to meet your maker by accepting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour. He is the way the truth and the Life. He doesn't deny anyone whoever you are, whatever you have done, wherever you u have been or whatever you have or don't have. Come the way you are come to Him. Today is the best day to come to Him and now is the best time.\n\n(Matthew 11:28\n[28]Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.)\n\n(John 3:16-18\n[16]For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.\n[17]For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.\n[18]“He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.)",2023-11-23,Thursday,23:00:00

Injuries must be getting worse so Vini is on notice. These 2 would not be a good match up front together.

Hypocrisy is when you know your man has acted so unprofessionall\ny but you go ahead to praise him. If he was on top of his game, he would have been scoring.

"Chinedu Godfrey Eke that's the basic there, it's not about winning the ball, it's bringing him down. The best way to stop Messi is to bring him down, and he had the chance while outside the 18yard. At least it would have slowed the game for other defenders and players to shuffle back to reinforce the defense.\nHe didn't understand that it was a World Cup Knockout game and it was Messi with the ball, he played like a fan, not a defender.

"Oni Adekunle there's nothing magical there bro, it's poor defending. For the title best defender, that's a disgrace to defenders I know. Wan Bissaka of United wouldn't allow Messi to leave that angle knowing his capabilities. It's not every goal that's the work of a genius in most cases, very lackadaisical and poor defending. I've seen Messi lose against a ten-man team because the defense was magnificent. This is very poor for a defender with such a title. He was trying to win the ball when all he needed was to take him down. You don't win the ball against Messi. You made him down, and Messi was too far from the 18 at that point.",2023-11-20,Monday,00:00:00

"Many coaches and players have come out to testify of having extra plans on stopping Messi whenever they are to face Messi but not many coaches nor players say same when talking about CR7, doesn't that alone prove a point to CR7 fans?

Nweke Johnson I’m pretty sure the reason he gave wasn’t because I hate him..he clearly stated y and the fact that u don’t like someone doesn’t mean every opinion about them is skewed tho. Let him say hazard or crespo is better than Ron n I can agree with ur hate thing,2023-11-18,Saturday,00:00:00

Your concluding sentence in the response gives me the feeling you have interest synchronizing with Mikel's assertion .\nLet me repeat the question again for clarity sake:\nWhen you confess to disliking someone because of his ego( ego as fathomed by you), what does it mean in your dictionary?\nAccolades abi I guess?",2023-11-18,Saturday,00:00:00

"Nweke Johnson golden boot is a reward for best goal scorer, and that is where CR7 fit in. Outside goals, he can't fit in anywhere. Do u want to give him playmaker award, which Messi won many times?, can he dribble like Messi?.\nObi played against Messi, in under 17 world cup. Nigeria and Obi saw shege from Messi, Obi played him in the world cup, Enyeama/\nNigeria saw shege.

"Damilola Oladimeji Just FYI, few persons vote for BDO not majority. So don't think it reflects the opinion of majority of football lovers. And how does it sound to you calling CR7 a flop? If that's not unbridled then I'm done with you on this engagement.",2023-11-18,Saturday,00:00:00

"Nweke Johnson you have both reasoning and assimilation problems. Why are you always changing the subject matter. You said they rob CR7, I pointed award that no one can rob(golden boot where Messi had6 over CR7 4). You asked again if football is all about goals, I pointed out for u again that outside goals,CR7 can't fit in. Then I told u he said what he said out of experience having faced Messi multiple times,from under 17 world cup till senior world yet faced humiliation. Now, u r bring another topic. Chelsea is one elite club in England, they have to snatched Mikel from utd. If he was not good, he won't be on demand by those two teams. For your information, football is not all about goal scoring,even if it was, why is CR7 short of golden boot from messi 6 Golden boot? Cr7 fans need prayers",2023-11-18,Saturday,00:00:00
Joe E. Idoko Sure I do have problem assimilating whatever you are purveying. Probably not adding up. What makes a good player for you is when two clubs fight for person regardless of the person's final output. Would there have been any need for argument since you ascribed that some stat were robbed? Keep praying for us,2023-11-18,Saturday,00:00:00
Nweke Johnson for you.,2023-11-20,Monday,00:00:00
I find it ridiculous people including professionals do this regarding two truly great players. We should all rejoice and feel lucky to have seen them play in the flesh. I’m sure in the future there will be others that follow equally as good if not better but come on look how good they both are,2023-11-18,Saturday,00:00:00
Rouge Rouge Are you saying that people should not be free to are their opinion on other Football players? The other day Zidane just proudly said much as he was good as a 10 but that Messi is 2 times better than him. Did that take anything away from Zidane being the legend of the game or made him disrespected my Messi or anyone in any way? It'sjust Ronaldo's fans tha make a fuss about all this when others air their opinion,2023-11-18,Saturday,00:00:00
"Mike Flynn Are you saying that footballers should not be free to air their opinion on other players based on their personal experiences? The other day, Zidane just proudly considered Messi to be 3 times better than him as a 10 although he himself was great. Did that take anything away from Zidane being the legend of the game or make him disrespected my Messi or anyone in any way?\n\nThese things are just normal personal opinion. It's just Ronaldo's fans that make a fuss about all this because they see it as reducing their favourite player which is actually not true. Because to me, I don't see how that takes anything away from what Ronaldo has achieved massively in the game.",2023-11-18,Saturday,00:00:00
I believe in freedom of speech so no I’m not saying that. My opinion also matters doesn’t it ? My opinion is why not enjoy both of them. Did you when you read my comment not understand that ? Zidane was a fabulous player and people out there will think he was as good as both Messi and Ronaldo. I think he was different as they are. There are a lot of fabulous players in football right now and over the last 20 years. But remember the old greats. There are many that can claim to being the best.,2023-11-18,Saturday,00:00:00

You think it's just hard work to be able to score bicycle kick goals? Tell me how many players can do those things easily. We know people like you, your love for Messi has clouded your judgment.

He brings a lot to the table: self-discipline\n, strict training regime, commitment, competitiveness\n, brilliant skills, epic positioning awareness, longevity and staggering goal-scoring capabilities.\n\nBut then, Lionel Messy is on a league of alien proportion. No comparison whatsoever! His on-field display is more of an Art than Sports. The mesmerizing symphony he orchestrates with his both legs is without precedence. Messy is undoubtedly the most gifted baller of all time: he's a goal alchemist, a dribbling monster, a speed thunderbolt, a dead ball magician, and a six yards box musketeer.\n\nIndeed, Lionel Messy is the quintessence of a football career. He's the most fulfilled player there is. Though yet active, but had already ticked all the trophy boxes in elite football and left no stone unturned in the process.\n\nI doff my cap!",2023-11-18,Saturday,00:00:00

"Nigerians are hypocritical in Nature that's why the human beings in Nigeria remains stagnantly underdeveloped even the so called Rich people here. Mikel during his playing days was praised by these same set of arrogant people who wants to squeeze him today because he spoke the truth. Mikel never played with both players as to say maybe us because he played with Messi that's why he's being sentimental rather he played against both Great players and in such position that exposed both icons to his game, after over 15yrs of his career, he evaluated the both and gave his verdict, now same people who praised him previously while in active service are scolding him. Truth they say is bitter. Wayne Rooney, Giggs, Becks etc are all united legends, they've over the years said the same thing yet Mikel has suddenly become someone who had a failed career.\nKeep being a hater of Messi and he keep thriving in every dimension. This is how some of you myopically dumbfounded irresponsible elements trolled him when he lost Copa, he came back and won Copa, then the narrative changed from him winning a trophy with national team to let him win World Cup if he wants to answer the G.O.A.T, last December God blessed gis trophy 🏆 cabinate with the most prestigious football trophy ever yet these sycophants ain't happy with his success.\n\nYour hypocrisy won't change the fact that this Guy called Messi is incredibly a blessed player and the greatest to ever graced the world of football.

Actually the debate isn't there indeed. Leo Messi such good class n stylish it's an insult to compare best player like to best striker like CR,2023-11-18,Saturday,00:00:00
"The insult Ronaldo receives on a daily is alarming….if you say Messi is the best dribbler in the world I can understand, but please don’t use dribbling to compare goal scoring. Everything we do on the football pitch whether dribbling or assisting all we expect is a goal. Without goals every effort is useless,goal win you trophies. Ronaldo’s all 5 balond’or and 5 champions league was earned. Being highest goal scoring in the most competitive league in the world…the Uefa champions league. No matter how people tend to downplay all Ronaldo has achieved simply because Messi won a World Cup for a country that has won it twice in the past is foolishness at its peak. World Cup doesn’t define a players greatness. When Ronaldo retires his records will continue to speak for him. Yes Messi is a great player but I can say he is more favored by the board. Ronaldo is always deemed the villain. He has given more in football. Him and Messi are the greatest and Messi himself knows that. For someone like mikel that took almost 4 years to score a goal for Chelsea.I bet he doesn’t understand what greatness is.",2023-11-19,Sunday,00:00:00

"Look at this one that wants to feel relevant again. Saying they are not comparable, Tell apart from the two of them, which other active footballers have 700+ goals. If you say the game is not about goals then you are foolish. Go and win a game with dribble. Dribble 7 players and play the ball to goal kick if that will win you the game. Sometimes we think because some is old, they will be wise. Stupid people also grow old. You will think a retired footballer will be unbiased because of his experience but stupid footballer also retire that's why they only score 6 goals in a club for 8 years. We know how many goals Essien scored at Chelsea and he was a midfielder too. He scored important goals. This moron now comes here to say Messi and Ronaldo are not comparable.

After all Messi was your age mate in football, both of you played in the same youth world cup where you performed very well by winning the second best player of the tournament then you went to Chelsea and decided to play safe instead of trying the possibility of becoming the best in the world rather you chose to be a defensive midfielder.

Citizen Johnson whatever you’re smoking you need to quit coz evidently it’s doing damage to your only braincell. Cech walks over all current keepers and most of past keepers. I’d put Casillas and Buffon over him and that’s it,2023-11-20,Monday,00:00:00

David Lawson actually Neuer is best the keeper by far. Do you watch football?? Every so called the best keeper played with some of the best defenders in the world when Neuer played with pretty much no defenders at all.,2023-11-20,Monday,00:00:00

"Mahebeng Albert Thulo Brr please quit watching football coz u just started watching football imagine saying bale at Tottenham and mentioning Neymar at only Barça,Neymar have been getting accolades since santos in Brazil league where not much people even watching their match,since Neymar have been winning Confederation cup being a MVP in the tournament with like of PUSKAS,and getting top 10 ranking in fifa Ballon D’or",2023-11-18,Saturday,00:00:00

Hor Lah Mii you really don’t get it neh…reason why I named Tottenham was to show you that Bale did it when was young at a big team in big league while Neymar was on fire in small league and you just said that where not much people watch their games. When he moved to Barca he only had two good seasons and please tell me if I’m lying.. whereas Bale was still on fire at Real for 5 years till injuries happened…. Bale is more of a results guy thats why Real won so many UCL with him. Neymar likes dribbling and that’s all…prime Bale was a nightmare to defenders with his pace and that time he was playing as a left back man 👨 ..,2023-11-19,Sunday,00:00:00

That 2016/2017 ucl,Neymar shared ucl top scorer alongside Messi & CR7 in 2014/2015.that is the player achievement aside of winning trophies for club is team success!\nSo in terms of goal scoring and assists Bale didn’t come near Neymar during their time in Laliga and ucl?\nSo no comparison from the start to the ends?",2023-11-20,Monday,00:00:00

Neymar yes was good at Santos but at Barca fact is that he two good seasons so please brother tell me who was the best….yall like Neymar cuz can dribble and shiit but he didn’t live up to expectations,2023-11-20,Monday,00:00:00

One was the best player of world cup while the other wasn't the best player of ucl... messi had more G/A than halaand... halaand didn't. Even qualify for the world cup.. it is an insult to football at large to give a stay at home guy the award....\n\nIniesta won the world cup but go check up his stats and overall play and contribution then compare it to messi copa de rey stats...

"Rootà Jr Biriàm Messi also got the golden ball & the silver boot in the WC, along with a decent season with PSG. If you exclude the team trophies, Messi still had the best stats in the year individually with those two individual achievements at WC. While Iniesta was obviously great, he was far behind Messi individually in 2010. Same goes for Sneijder. To win the Balon D'Or, you gotta win some trophies and perform individually at the same time.",2023-11-18,Saturday,00:00:00

"Benny Ten it makes all the sense in the world when you know PSG is own by a group from Qatar, Messi signed for PSG just before de World Cup but left to the US just after the World Cup because Messi realized that he always hated Paris. Now imagine being Qatar and have the golden opportunity to have Messi winning the World Cup in your country (that’s probably the reason behind him playing for PSG). Then you give Argentina an easy group in the WC (even Tata Martino said that he was glad Argentina won that game against Mexico in the group stages, but guess what? he was Mexico’s freaking coach / even some mexican players said the game plan vs Argentina was very weird). Then the press said that a player from Argentina who actually played in the WC was positive after a drug test before the WC but still they allowed him to play. Finally, many French players were sick with the flu days before the final, including the goalkeeper (obviously no Argentinians got sick, why??). So yeah, it makes all the sense in the world.",2023-11-18,Saturday,00:00:00

"The difference is that iniesta never won man of the tournament or golden boot, in 2018 Luka modric won the golden boot hence he won the Ballon D'OR, Messi won everything, man of the match , man if the tournament, most assists, most goals and golden boot,so he just had to win it",2023-11-17,Friday,00:00:00

Kendy Sims I believe we've had this chat before. Refer to the previous chats. It's tiring that we keep revising the same chapter. The criteria is inconsistent and the award is prone to bias. Today you win because of world cup next it's because of club acheivements next it's because of more goals. And 100 journalists to vote most of whom never follow the three basic criteria but are swayed by popularity. Refer to the analysis on balon dor on my timeline,2023-11-18,Saturday,00:00:00

Winning the treble got to jack all that drinking and acting up and injury made him lose his play in the team to a more dynamic player in doku . If jack plays the way he did when he was at villa ain’t no way Doku is taking his place but somewhere down the line he lost who he was and is now less consistent to the person he once was so Doku will be the man from now on until or if jack finds back himself.,2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00

If you talk about awards fine Messi is leading but if you talk about greatness, Messi is no where near Ronaldo. Ronaldo can dribble, pass and score. He has done it in 3 different leagues and now doing it in Saudi, that alone should tell you how great he is. Messi can't even talk about football if he's Barcelona and Argentina stats are left out. Messi is good but don't compare him to Ronaldo because Ronaldo left he's comfort zones and prove to the world that he's indeed the greatest.

Arni Arnason … Arsenal should also focus why they had only 1 shot on target the whole game. New castle were clearly a better team. I think managers trying to make VAR look bad to cover up their bad job.,2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00
Arcot Obrien Ba I give Credit to Newcastel for that Arsenal had only one shot on goal,2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00

Peter Gbargbar we supposed to speak the truth even if it affect us...,2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00
Peter Gbargbar VAR has been very inconsistent this season. At least a third of the PL teams have been affected by bad/\ninconsistent VAR decisions this season and it's not half way yet.\nIt's bad. Stop being too much of a team fanatic and look at the bigger picture. Football matches in general are slowly decided outside the pitch. It's pathetic.,2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00
"Jabir Hamisi S Thanks for your comment. No insults so I can say something here.\nYou see, I\'ve never praised VAR for once. In England, it was once called ""VARchester United"" because it was constantly awarding penalties to them. Now, they are the ones crying the most.\nIt has affected Chelsea and many other clubs.\nBut when these wrong practices are allowed to continue and those not affected feel that it\'s not their business, I bet you, it will definitely come to them someday. Arsenal is just one latest victim that is crying now.\nBut have they complained about VAR before?\nToday, other clubs are celebrating because Arsenal is the victim but it will come to them too.\nIt will continue until all the clubs come together with one voice against VAR.\nAs long as it doesn\'t matter to those not affected, it will continue.\nJose Mourinho complained about VAR a long time ago when he said that people may be called from dressing room to come back and that one should not celebrate a goal until VAR approves. He was literally complaining but no one took him seriously.\nNow every club is having a share of it.",2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00

"Yeah sure, after viewing three 3⃣ into one situation for 4 minutes without the rightful result, VAR give 4 minutes as stoppage time. I think VAR is one of worst investment by the Premier League and since it can't work better, let it be sent back into testing mode. Besides, any apologies should be rejected by Arsenal. Because bad officiating against Arsenal is nothing new, it happen so many times even before the introduction of VAR.

Stuart Cox yep. Talked to him the other day...says he's gonna score 40 again,2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00
Stuart Cox Harry Kane scores more goals since he is surrounded by other quality players. Halland played in the Bundesliga but he didn't score the number of goals he has so far scored in EPL,2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00

Shidu De Keddy Kane was actually one of the best strikers in EPL… if not the best. He’s always been world class actually,2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00

Prince Nyarko That's an imagination and a blatant lie. Halland and Bellingham played at the Bundesliga but they didn't score loads of goals like they are scoring in EPL and Laliga. Bayern Munich not only wins in the Bundesliga but has so far has won all UCL matches both home and away,2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00

Ballon dor - Ronaldo again 🤣 Year 2006, Ronaldinho won La Liga and Champions League, Cannavaro won World Cup. Ballon dor? Cannavaro. Year 2014, Ronaldo won Champions League, Neuer won league + World Cup. Ballon dor? Ronaldo again 🤣. Ronaldo fans say that Lewandovski was stolen in 2021. Lewandovski in 2021 had 60 goals and 10 assists. In 2016, Messi had 59 goals and 31 assists but Ronaldo won Ballon dor 🤣 Penaldo is a FIFA boy, not Messi.

"Eric Filor Nagbe Sr. He completed "" football "" yet he is still chasing and attending Ballon\'dor ceremonies to collect more? If he is , he should have stayed home. Ronaldo on the other hand, doesn\'t bother about those fake awards anymore, neither does he attend their staged ceremonies. Who\'s chasing na? 🤣🤣",2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00
"Ed Elliott, the reward for the completed task in 2022 was what he went to receive.

How ironical that is. 🏃🏃",2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00

"Ed Elliott, where was Haaland in December of 2022? All of the serious footballers were in Qatar... Where was he? No serious-minded footballer was out of Qatar at that time.

Brazil, USA, Germany, England, Nigeria, South Africa, you name it... 🤓🤓🤓",2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00
"Eric Filor Nagbe Sr. The Ballon'dor should not be reduced to a player only winning the world cup during the world cup year after scoring few penalties and tap-ins at the world cup. It is a travesty to the competition, and unfair to the other contestants. Favouritism shouldn't override reasoning in these things, but sadly, that is the case.",2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00
"Ed Elliott, interestingly, the WC doesn't only come to the spotlight during the competition. Look at the qualifying stage, the different stages from group to knockout to QF, to Semi's and then Finals. Look at the roles they play in each of those stages - Messi was indeed outstanding. He didn't only win WC, he also won other things with his club and Country. Let not the hate and rivalry between Madrid and Barcelona blind you to the facts and stats 😂",2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00

"Eric Filor Nagbe Sr., leave the sentiments and answer this question, simply. Am I to believe that a player who won the treble, scoring 52 goals in the process, should not have won the Ballon'dor ahead of a player who only one the domestic league and a pitiful world cup, while scoring 11 goals in the process? This is beyond my understanding oh..Hehehehehe.\n..this is funny🤣🤣",2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00
"Ed Elliott, if you call a World Cup Medal - the biggest sporting accolade in the world, ""a pitiful world cup"", then there is no need to argue further. Why do you think the entire footballing world comes to a standstill when the WorldCupis being played? All of those funny, funny leagues and competitions come to a close because of the World Cup.\n\nI\'m very surprised 🤭 you didn\'t know that. 🥲😢🤓... Please do not let plenty people see ur comment.

"Hay que aceptar que CR7 es el segundo mejor de todos los tiempos pero con una liga como la de Arabia jactarse de seguir siendo competitivo es un cliché, al igual que Messi en la MLS, pero hay que tener en cuenta que de tanto que se le dice a Messi que es por penales y tales pues sin penales Messi tendría más goles que CR7 en menos partidos jugados, Messi ya lo ha ganado todo y el debate se acabó cuando Messi en una sola temporada con el barca hizo 91 goles y CR7 en esa misma temporada hizo 63 es una diferencia gigantesca así que por ello y por lo que ha ganado Messi es y seguirá siendo el verdadero GOAT",2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00

Play in la liga or serie a or bundesliga but not the premier league.\nHalland can never win the Ballondor.\nNo premier league player this decade will win the Ballondor.\nIt is a crime for premier league players to win the Ballondor\n2023 -Messi inter Miami\n2024- Jude Bellingham real Madrid\n2025- mbappe or vini Jr if and only if mbapee comes to real Madrid\n2026 -musiala\nMost Ballondor\nMost UCL\nMost uel\nMost club world cup\nYou name the European trophy la liga's got it\nFor more unrivaled football vawulence contact me😅😅,2023-10-27,Friday,00:00:00

Who cares? It has no value anymore.... mind you d'or is not for the best players. Its not Fifa awards. Its just an award organised by some group of people in France so the award is always predecided before the party...nothing\nmore than that.

Halaand for sure next season\nMbappe would have no chance while staying at psg and madrid Won't win any european title with this one man carrying squad.\n\nSo the ballon should be given to halaand among these,2023-10-27,Friday,00:00:00
If Bellingham can continue with this form and also able to win the CL and La liga. That will be an easy win for him,2023-10-27,Friday,00:00:00

Didier de la brousse fume du chambre ! Il va même trop vite à dire que Messi n’est pas meilleur que Mbappé et pourtant avec Messi nous avons toutes les preuves qu’il a accompli avec une carrière la plus longue dans le football mais Mbappé on ne sait pas encore s’il fera la carrière de Messi et en terme du génie de Messi ni Cristiano ni Mbappé personne n’est proche de Messi . Un jaloux de Deschamps qui a perdu contre argentine voire même contre le Portugal . Ça se prouve maintenant que t’étais juste un chanceux en gagnant la coupe du monde.

"What a JOKE and absolute ROBBERY!!\n\n2010, Iniesta won World Cup, Sneijder won treble, but Messi won the Ballon d' Or. Football pundits claim as Ballon d' or is a individual award, only individual performance must considered, not the trophy, as trophy depends on the collective performance!\n\nIn 2012, Iniesta won the EURO being the best player of the tournament, Messi won the ballon d' or. In an individual award, collective achievement (trophy) shouldn’t be counted, football pundits claim.\n\nIn 2013, Ribery won the treble with 22 goals, Ronaldo scored 69 goals! Ronaldo won the ballon d' or! Football pundit claimed, Ronaldo never deserved ballon d' or he failed to win trophy for his team!\nSo, what happens in 2010 & 2012!\n\nIn 2018, Ronaldo and Modric won the UCL in the same team! Ronaldo became top scorer with most player of the week in UCL, Modric won the best player of the WC, Modric won the ballon d' or! Football pundits failed to show any logics in favour of modric!\n\nIn 2019, Van dijk won the ucl with his best performance, but ballon d or is given to Messi. just individual performance should be considered in an individual award. So Van dijk never deserved it!\n\nIn 2021, Messi won the copa, Lewandowski scored numerous goals! Fotball pundits claim Lewandowski's numerous goals failed to win any trophy for the team, so Lewa never deserved it.\nSo what they claimed in 2010, 2012, 2013 😂😂😂\n\nIn 2023, Messi won the world with the help of FIFA, bottled in UCL! Haalan became the first player to score 50+ goals with an EPL team, and won the treble. But, Messi wins the ballon d'or, as world cup bigger than individual performance and the treble!\nEvery year they show different logics for as the criteria of a ballon d or winner!",2023-10-27,Friday,00:00:00

Remember when Jorginho won it all with Chelsea and with Italy, he wasn't even in the top three?\n\nYou guys should reason well.",2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00

"Henry Winter, editor-in-chief\nof The Times on why he voted for Leo Messi for the Ballon d'Or.\n\n“This may be the last time we celebrate Messi as the best player in the world, but the issue has nothing to do with nostalgia, nor with clinging to a romance that is fading. Rather, Messi deserves the Ballon d'Or.\n\nWhen I voted for England for the Ballon d'Or, I thought carefully about the incredible work of Haaland and Mbappé, studied their amazing statistics and best shots, and then came back to Messi.\n\nMessi led Argentina to win the World Cup last season with a performance comparable to Maradona's in the 1986 World Cup.\n\nFootball is about titles and Messi's performance in Qatar showed that he deserved first place and six points. Although Messi's career was brilliant with four Champions League titles, he needed a World Cup.\n\nAll the pressure was on their shoulders, especially with a young coach like Scaloni and a team that included three important young players in Enzo, Álvarez and Mac Allister. At times, especially after the first surprising loss against Saudi Arabia, Messi was under more pressure, and when his country needed him most, Messi responded.\n\nHe won the award for best player in the World Cup and scored 7 goals of quality and variety: long-distance goals against Mexico and Australia, deep goals against France and penalty kicks taken with different left, right, high and low goals. Messi also gave three assists and played every minute of the tournament.\n\nNo player has taken more shots on goal than him (32). Only Antoine Griezmann has more key passes than Messi, who has 21. Only Musiala and Mbappé dribbled more than him, and no player was exposed to more fouls than him.\n\nIf some of those who mock him might suggest that referees are influenced by his reputation, the reality is that Messi is being attacked and his amazing movements confuse opponents who jump and catch him.\n\nBy all standards, Messi was the most effective in the most important tournament in sport, but Messi is not just numbers, he is much more. Messi is poetry. Messi is the one who surprises you. Messi is that sudden burst of speed and that touch to keep the ball away from a defender like Gvardiol.\n\nMessi is a special role model for the younger generation who follows the stars as much as the teams. Attending a match with your team is completely different from another match. “A Messi match in itself is considered an event.”",2023-10-27,Friday,00:00:00

Won the man of the match award with Argentina against Italy at Finallisima. Man of the match at World Cup final 2023, arguably the best World Cup final in football history. How can a guy like penaldo who is just another mediocre player without Real Madrid be compared with Messi, who also won the treble twice with Barcelona. Pendu was nothing special at a star studded Man Utd either. He was lucky to win Balon d or 2008 because Messi was still very young. The following year Messi destroyed Pendu’ Man Utd at the champions league final. Deshchamp is just a sore loser to give that statement.

Messi Has 8 And CR7 Has 5 So What Is The Big Deal..,2023-10-27,Friday,00:00:00
Uche Nna Okeke Ronaldo fans are the ones hating on Messi because they never believed he worth all he's achieved in football. Why won't I defend Messi? How can someone say that a UCL winner deserves the Balloon D'or over a world champion? Did Pele and Maradona win any UCL trophy? No! But they're considered the greatest. I'm not hating on Ronaldo and I can never watch anyone say that any other player than Messi is better than Ronaldo because I know and love football.,2023-10-27,Friday,00:00:00

Uche Nna Okeke a defender won the Balloon D'or in 2006 when almighty Ronaldinho won the UCL with Barcelona because of world cup. Why did Modric win it in 2018? Someone was awarded 5 MOTM in 7 games and won the golden ball with goals in every stage of the biggest competition and you're here comparing him to who couldn't take his country to the world cup and even ghosted in UCL knockout stage. Haaland wouldn't have been the favorite if Ronaldo was the world champion.,2023-10-27,Friday,00:00:00

Uche Nna Okeke if? You know it's not possible for Haaland to perform wonders in the world cup like Messi did. I believe if we remove sentiments we'll realize that world cup is the biggest competition as far as football is mentioned. Bro has forgotten how Messi lost the 2014 Balloon D'or to Ronaldo after winning the golden ball in the world cup just because he failed to lift the trophy and now he's lifted the trophy Haaland is now the favorite.,2023-10-27,Friday,00:00:00

Bro you're dreaming with your if, and even if Ronaldo wins the next world cup Messi remains the Goat because the goals Ronaldo is so good at, Messi got more golden boots than him.

His point became moot when he mentioned Mbappe. Messi is the only footballer that can play both in midfield and in the forward line and still succeed. The latter can only play in one position. It's debatable when you mentioned Cr7 but Mbappe? Comon Deschamps!,2023-10-27,Friday,00:00:00

Messi has the most goals and goal contributions in finals of any footballer in history. It is very difficult to argue against him being the best given the fact that beyond all of this, his style of play is exciting yet direct.

James Richard that's a lie. He was booed before the world cup,2023-10-27,Friday,00:00:00
"Tyrus Sun you make not one, but two comments, preaching against bitterness and jealousy, yet your comments are bitterness overload. You espouse the lofty values of not ""creating rivalry even wen [sic, this from a person of proper learning, lol] there is none"" but your comments do nothing but fuel the fire of rivalry.",2023-10-27,Friday,00:00:00
"Eddries Lepelle Ronaldo didn’t score it was Mane, maybe he just tried to claim it was his goal as he was on the pitch at the time",2023-10-27,Friday,00:00:00
"Ronaldo has always been bitter from day one.\nHe is the guy who wanted to finish with more golden boots than Messi, he wanted more golden ball, he wanted the world cup. He said all these in interviews.",2023-10-27,Friday,00:00:00
"NA Zor II used him for what ? Messi is living his dream ..he said all this in interview when Messi suppassed him in Ballon di\'or ,he brought this one "" golden boot is better than ballon di\'or because one is a vote and one his your achievement "" buh reality Messi is bigger than all his dreams 😂😂😂",2023-10-27,Friday,00:00:00

Tyrus Sun bitter people are you who go to stadiums 🏟 trying to disrupt somebody with way less Balon Dors than your hero Messi. Shows you how obsessed and insecure with Ronaldo you're. That's a fact!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣\n\nRonaldo's happy and you're not!,2023-10-27,Friday,00:00:00

Robert Ochieng Think of how messi was trolled for lack of international trophy between 2014 to -2020. He was merely a laughing stock for his misfortune. What messi went through is what CR7 is experiencing now. He just have to understand people can sometimes behave this way and get over it,2023-10-27,Friday,00:00:00
"Robert Ochieng respect is earned not given, he doesn’t respect anyone not even his own team mates, trying to claim someone else’s goal proves how selfish and self absorbed he is",2023-10-27,Friday,00:00:00

Year 2013, Messi and Ribery won everything, Ronaldo better statistics but Ballon dor - Ronaldo. 2016 and 2017 year, Messi better statistics, Ronaldo won Champions League. Ballon dor - Ronaldo again 🤣 Year 2006, Ronaldinho won La Liga and Champions League, Cannavaro won World Cup. Ballon dor? Cannavaro. Year 2014, Ronaldo won Champions League, Neuer won league + World Cup. Ballon dor? Ronaldo again 🤣. Ronaldo fans say that Lewandovski was stolen in 2021. Lewandovski in 2021 had 60 goals and 10 assists. In 2016, Messi had 59 goals and 31 assists but Ronaldo won Ballon dor 🤣 Penaldo is a FIFA boy, not Messi. P.S. 2002 year, Brazilian Ronaldo scored only 20 goals in year but won Ballon dor. Why? World cup.",2023-11-06,Monday,00:00:00

And if that is the case you MUST then pick Rodri over Casemiro.\n\nAnd Martinez is a one trick pony, physical solid defender.\n\nStones can do the same, play fullback or outside centerback in a 3, step into DM in the 6 or 8, he even was playing as an attacking mid last season at a very high level.\n\nThis kid is an idiot 😂\n\nManchester is blue 💙",2023-10-28,Saturday,00:00:00

After one game vs barcelona getting started you were lucky Barca couldn't convert the chances the hited 3 times the woodwork,2023-10-28,Saturday,00:00:00
"Nav Id Id which wood work, guy go n get the stats Madrid had more goal on target than Barca stop this hitting bar, didn't Madrid hit bar too. More over gundogan goal was an avoidable goal. It was error. That is what u call luck but madrid went for it . If it was luck Barca is not supposed to win CELTA, Porto, n Villarreal,go back and watch the match especially Villarreal, Villarreal had 5 good clear chances but couldn't converted it ,before gavi score their first attempt, what happened against Bilbao. U lost move on which one is u hit bar thrice so what, did gavi not even foul kroose before the ball fell to fermin it was even a foul but the ref allowed it",2023-10-28,Saturday,00:00:00

"Mala Cliff to a large extent you are right. Infact, he was even selfish at times and he likes dribbles too much. He likes to attract attention too much when he's having the ball. He is a good player but I think he is not being helpful to his team mate",2023-10-28,Saturday,00:00:00

That Barca midfield got the best of the entire Madrid diamond midfield without De Jong and Pedri….we are talking 2 youngsters in Gavi and Lopez. That should tell you something. But at the end of the day the intricacies of the game gets you points…,2023-10-28,Saturday,00:00:00
Sleks Cass Magowe you lost the game stop telling about youngsters. Is Bellingham not a youngster?,2023-10-28,Saturday,00:00:00
Gatsheni Mandla Brighton i did not play any game…that was just my profound opinion…Madrid played and won the game so what is that has to do with me or you?…,2023-10-28,Saturday,00:00:00

Abdullahi Mohammed Luth to be honest we dominated them like it wasn’t even funny in the first half though we squandered a lot of goal scoring chances…Without\na couple of goals in the first half was the reason why Madrid was never out of the game…i am totally ok with this specific defeat…i am just annoyed by the way they scored…it was one of those the ever confusing habit of our players to totally switch off whatever the crucial scenario is….i just don’t understand the behaviour…Remem\nber the CL games where we lost in this way and not because we were playing bad at that?….I am totally convinced had Pedri or De Jong available or both if we wanna get nasty it would have been a different story…I didn’t see any bright moments throughout the game except those 2 brilliant goals from Bellingham that they combined consistently….T\nhat also should tell you something…Jude also acknowledged and said it himself that they were bad…In the end goals counts as Gavi said….The Next El Clasico should be all about making a statement,2023-10-28,Saturday,00:00:00

He even won a treble while Messi only got ligue 1. He won the world cup and champions league in one year. In France, Mbappe was voted best PSG player and best ligue 1 player. So if the excuse for fronting Messi to win ballon dor ahead of the people's favourite Halaand is world cup, why not Alvarez who won both world cup and champions league? He switched to Inter Miami and the social media streets are quiet like nothing happened, infact the hype ended an hour after announcement.

Messi only needed one pass to reach Ronaldo's assist record in UCL. but despite the absence of Ronaldo in two seasons he was not able to do that(one pass in two seasons)\nIt is illogical to talk about other Goat records with Messi specially the Most goals,2023-05-28,Sunday,00:00:00
He never started the season there and didn't feature in every match and they couldn't win the league as well but a player that has 14 goals in 16 matches has such an outstanding season\nMaybe they see him as a debutant and wasn't considered to be there,2023-05-28,Sunday,00:00:00
"Babatunde Raymond ok let me help ur ignorance, a commenter said CR7 dis not make it to the saudi best team because he came into the league half way into the season(by January)\n\nAnother commenter said but not starting the seaaon is not a yardstick not to name him in the squad because he did well and he tried to justify it by saying Casemiro joined manchester by january but ended up as their best player, i just corrected the notion that he came to manchester by january......no\nw apologize to me and move on.",2023-05-28,Sunday,00:00:00

"Cristiano Ronaldo scored 14 league goals in 19 league games, and the top scorer went to a player who scored 5 goals more than him with 19 goals from 27 league games. This is a complete embarrassment from the organizers of the “Saudi Pro League team of the season”.\n\nPunctuality is better than numbers, the goal ratio for both player(14 goals in 19 games) and 19 goals in 27 games are far apart and unmatched.",2023-05-28,Sunday,00:00:00

Billiscobar the problem is when Ronaldo joined Alnassir they were competing for all the four domestic trophies and after he joined they lost all the cup finals Ronaldo is a goal poacher that's the only thing he knows better but he cannot play the game that's what makes him so different from the other allien from Argentina Ronaldo have gone cold for 3 years outside juventus he is finished,2023-05-28,Sunday,00:00:00

And, yes! I am just a human like you but I know from Allaah that which you do not know. Also, my knowledge is not hypothetical or based on assumptions or percentages, but the true clarification of the Book of my Lord is undoubtedly 100% correct\nPerhaps all questioners would like to say: "" O man, you have indeed filled us with dread with the title of the statement that says: Urgent: News of a Great Global Calamity, so what is it?"", Then Allaah\'s caliph Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani replies to you and says: It is a firm plan of Allaah by a COVID that will annihilate 500 million out of each 1 billion people and I am thoroughly truthful and accurate. Among them is the despicable dragon Xi Jinping the president of China who disobeyed the order of Allaah\'s caliph on the worlds. The early arrogant ones provide statistics of zero deaths by corona but they know they are liars even if infections were in millions every 24 hours. For instance, if infections were 1 million every 24 hours they would announce 100 cases only, even if cases reached 100 million in 24 hours they would hide 99% of them\nO Arabs and Non-Arabs, lo and behold! Is it reasonable that a country whose population is in billions but its COVID cases are in tens and hundreds? While other countries whose populations are in millions yet their cases are in hundreds of thousands? They are all liars and do not tell people the truth. And if Arab media professionals are asked why the cases in China are in tens they would reply: ""China is putting an end to corona and that is why you see they have been having zero death cases a long time ago"", It is as if they are anti-death!

I'm no fan of Ronaldos ego but regardless of the money he's bringing attention to a league that would otherwise not be known of it wasn't for him making the move.\n\nThe snobbery of pundits and fans criticising him is pathetic and the calls for action to be taken against players moving there is a joke. If it means because of his involvement kids in the middle east aspire to become footballers that can only be a good thing for fans.\n\nReal have been stealing talent for years. Fuckem and the rest if they can't stand the competition.,2023-07-28,Friday,00:00:00

Geremi Njitap from Cameroon won 2 UCLs for Madrid in 1999/2000 and 2001/02 alongside La Liga and other trophies, he was even nominated for ballon d'or in that period. Achraf Hakimi from Morocco also won the UCL in 2017/18, Club World Cup, Spanish Super cup with Madrid. Mahamadou Diarra from Mali won 2 La Ligas with Madrid in 2006/07 and 2007/08. Madrid even went ahead to sign average Africans like Javier Balboa from Equatorial Guinea who also had an opportunity to win La Liga in 2007/08. Valdo Lopes from Cape Verde also had an opportunity to win the 2001/02 UCL with Madrid. Adebayor from Togo came and won the 2010/11 Copa Del Rey with Madrid. Essien also joined and had an opportunity to win the 2012 Spanish Supercup. Your claims are absolutely baseless. Osimhen can be signed by Madrid if his performance merits it",2023-05-28,Sunday,00:00:00

Shrawan Bista there's no perfect replacement. Because you are good in a team doesn't mean you'll be good in another. Mbappe might eventually come here and be a flopp. He isn't even a proper 9. He is a winger. He wants to run🤷🏽\u200d♂️,2023-05-28,Sunday,00:00:00

They didn't give osimhen best player award cause they said he scored only goals and krav scored 10+ goals and assist but Halland was given best player for scoring only goals and then you say we have syndrome. Have you ever checked how many player of the year award drogba, Eto or George has? Yet we have people who didn't perform upto them given player of the year, imagine how yaya toure carried mancity midfield on his shoulders for year's before pep came and then a David Silva comes within a short time and becomes mancity legend even got a statue.

Alexandre Isichei many and many player of the season check his stats for each season he played at Chelsea and check his awards. Apart From that malouda is still considered one of Chelsea best striker ahead Drogba which isn't fair despite Drogba being among Chelsea highest goal scorer,2023-05-28,Sunday,00:00:00
Stephen Bamidele Drogba won the EPL top scorer award because he scored the most goals in 2006(20) and 2009(29). That's fair...🤷. Then that notion that Malouda is 'still considered as one of the best strikers ahead of Drogba' is false. Bobby Tambling(202) and Kerry Dixon(193) are the only two strikers ahead of Drogba(164) in the list of the best strikers of the club. Malouda is not even in the top 10.,2023-05-28,Sunday,00:00:00

Raymond S. Blamo d post only stated d fact. Osimhen is d 1st African to win d Serie A top scorer award. Or did Weah or Eto'o win before him? Read ur comment all over & u'll see u are d one making comparisons,2023-05-28,Sunday,00:00:00
He did this without penalties. Super amazing,2023-05-28,Sunday,00:00:00
If Osimhen had played during the days of Eto'o & George Weah he would barely get 5 goals.,2023-05-28,Sunday,00:00:00

Etoo was never the main striker at Inter but yet his numbers are still up there\nThis comparison is irrelevant in terms of Etoo and Weah Osimhen is a kid at least for now,2023-05-28,Sunday,00:00:00
And George Weah has what no African player have or will have. You don't have to discredit other better prolific strikers just to promote your own. There is no sense in it.,2023-05-28,Sunday,00:00:00
Adibeli Uche Destiny look at this one records are mearnt to be broken so if u think no African player can break weah's record that means u are just playing,2023-05-28,Sunday,00:00:00

"Lim Yew Chen there is nothing like delusional here you are the one that is delusional....I\nam sure you don't even watch PSG matches not to talk of the highlights but instead you are the type that go to check scoreline after every single match.... Robert ochieng is right the PSG team is not balance,,,,, the mid field is not creative enough & that kind of limit the ball supply to the forward three..... Most time Messi have to drop deep to collect the ball which sometimes spoil they game plan...PSG mid-field is not creative & inexperience only verrati & funny enough verrati is not a creative midfielder but a defensive midfielder.. In general the team is just not balance....simp\nle",2023-05-28,Sunday,00:00:00

Robert Ochieng did Mbappe needed his help to win the WC 2018? He went to PSG to get tips from Mbappe on how to win the WC. Small boy with great experience. I guess Ronaldo should have done the same. Mbappe is the only one can that can decide how high he wants to soar because he's a complete player,2023-05-28,Sunday,00:00:00
